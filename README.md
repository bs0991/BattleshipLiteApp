## How to Play

1. Each player selects five grid positions to place their ships.
2. Players take turns guessing the opponentâ€™s ship positions by entering grid coordinates (e.g., `A1`).
3. If the selected coordinate contains an opponentâ€™s ship, it will be marked with **X** (hit).
4. If the guess is incorrect, the coordinate will be marked with **O** (miss).
5. The game continues until one player hits all five of the opponentâ€™s ships.
